                Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) is a coenzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, particularly in cellular energy production and as a cofactor in redox reactions. It exists in two forms: NADP+ (oxidized form) and NADPH (reduced form), and is involved in processes such as photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and the synthesis of fatty acids and nucleotides. NADP is a derivative of niacin (vitamin B3) and serves as an electron carrier in many metabolic pathways.

It is the biochemical process that sustains the biosphere as the basis for the food chain. The oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis allowed the formation of the ozone layer, the evolution of aerobic respiration and thus complex multicellular life.</h5>

            <p>The positive sign of the standard free energy change of the reaction (ΔG°) given above means that the reaction requires energy (an endergonic reaction). The energy required is provided by absorbed solar energy, which is converted into the chemical bond energy of the products.</p>

            <p>Photosynthesis converts ∼200 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into complex organic compounds annually and produces ∼140 billion tonnes of oxygen into the atmosphere. By facilitating conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, photosynthesis acts as the primary energy input into the global food chain. Nearly all living organisms use the complex organic compounds derived from photosynthesis as a source of energy. The breakdown of these organic compounds occurs via the process of aerobic respiration, which of course also requires the oxygen produced by photosynthesis.</p>

            <img src="images/Equations2.png" alt="">
            <p>Unlike photosynthesis, aerobic respiration is an exergonic process (negative ΔG°) with the energy released being used by the organism to power biosynthetic processes that allow growth and renewal, mechanical work (such as muscle contraction or flagella rotation) and facilitating changes in chemical concentrations within the cell (e.g. accumulation of nutrients and expulsion of waste). The use of exergonic reactions to power endergonic ones associated with biosynthesis and housekeeping in biological organisms such that the overall free energy change is negative is known as ‘coupling’.</p>
            <p>Photosynthesis and respiration are thus seemingly the reverse of one another, with the important caveat that both oxygen formation during photosynthesis and its utilization during respiration result in its liberation or incorporation respectively into water rather than CO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, glucose is one of several possible products of photosynthesis with amino acids and lipids also being synthesized rapidly from the primary photosynthetic products.</p>
            <p>The consideration of photosynthesis and respiration as opposing processes helps us to appreciate their role in shaping our environment. The fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> by photosynthesis and its release during breakdown of organic molecules during respiration, decay and combustion of organic matter and fossil fuels can be visualized as the global carbon cycle (Figure 1).</p>

                The relationship between respiration, photosynthesis and global CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> levels.
                
                At present, this cycle may be considered to be in a state of imbalance due to the burning of fossil fuels (fossilized photosynthesis), which is increasing the proportion of CO<sub>2</sub> entering the Earth's atmosphere, leading to the so-called ‘greenhouse effect’ and human-made climate change.</p>
